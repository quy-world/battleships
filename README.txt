Welcome to my multiplayer battleships game, please find a live example on http://quy.world/battleships.
However if you wish, you may also download and hook it up to a database yourself and try the 
game on your own local server!

The game is for two players. Each player may buy and place ships on their map and can also
use the turrets on their ships that have not been hit by the enemy to engage the enemy targets.
The game is won when the opponent has run out of money and all their ships have been sunk.
